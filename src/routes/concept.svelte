		<h2>âš¡ Origin</h2>
		<p>
			30 years ago, someone sat in a lab, looking over a bunch of wires and thought, 'Lol, what if
			we use cables to carry light from continent to another'. We're probably oversimplifying this
			but as a result, more opportunities were borne out of this radical invention. According to a
			recent study, fibre cables lined up across the East African coast have handled up to 500 PB
			worth of data in the past 12 months. This is all too exciting for businesses that rely on
			rapid transfer and relay of large amounts of data.
		</p>
		<p>
			Seemingly, the only thing that hinders 100% efficiency is <i>hidden latency</i>. So hidden,
			that it took 20 years of worldwide operation for it to be discovered by us.
