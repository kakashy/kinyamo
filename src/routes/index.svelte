			Kinyamo seeks to solve problems that have been around ever since the first fibre cables
			touched our shores - <i>hidden latency.</i>
			Three scientist from Kenya Institute of Mitambo set out to study and probe the causes of latency
			when fibre cables experience maximum throughput. Our findings and proposed solutions were published
			in a journal, available <a href="#">here</a> and <a href="#">here</a>.
		</p>
		<p>
			In addition, we were awarded grants from <a href="/glossary#ibf"
				>International Bank Federation</a
			>
			which propelled <a href="/implementation">implementation</a>
			and mass-production of a plug-n-play device to attenuate light signals inside FCs.
